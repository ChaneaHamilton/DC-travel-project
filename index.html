            <h2>Why Washington DC</h2>
            <h3>Washington DC, the U.S capital</h3>
            <p>
              Washington, DC, the U.S. capital, is a compact city on the Potomac
              River, bordering the states of Maryland and Virginia. It’s defined
              by imposing neoclassical monuments and buildings – including the
              iconic ones that house the federal government’s 3 branches: the
              Capitol, White House and Supreme Court. It's also home to iconic
              museums and performing-arts venues such as the Kennedy Center.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded on July 16, 1790, Washington, DC is unique among American
              cities because it was established by the Constitution of the
              United States to serve as the nation’s capital. You can read the
              actual line at the National Archives. From its beginning, it has
              been embroiled in political maneuvering, sectional conflicts and
              issues of race, national identity, compromise and, of course,
              power.

                  Touring the National Mall should top your list of must-do’s
                  when you visit the District. Free monuments, memorials and
                  museums are all around, including the famous Lincoln and
                  Jefferson memorials and the popular National Museum of African
                  American History and Culture. Walk next to the Reflecting Pool
                  and you can hear American history in your footsteps, from the
                  sacrifices made by soldiers to the powerful words of Martin
                  Luther King, Jr.

                  These are America’s museums, so there is no charge to visit
                  them! All Smithsonian museums have interactive components and
                  unparalleled collections of artifacts. The hard part is
                  choosing which ones to visit. Visitors often flock to the
                  National Air and Space Museum for its journeys into space and
                  the National Museum of American History for its in-depth look
                  at our nation’s past. Also, be sure to check out the recently
                  renovated Freer | Sackler Galleries, which are dedicated to
                  Asian art.
